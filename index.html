                            States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during World War II. Designed and built by Lockheed in 1943
                            and delivered just 143 days from the start of design, two pre-production models saw limited
                            service in Italy just before the end of World War II. Designed with straight wings, the type
                            saw extensive combat in Korea with the United States Air Force (USAF) as the F-80.</p>

                        <p>The Republic F-84 Thunderjet is an American turbojet fighter-bomber aircraft. Originating as
                            a 1944 United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) proposal for a "day fighter", the F-84 first
                            flew in 1946. Although it entered service in 1947, the Thunderjet was plagued by so many
                            structural and engine problems that a 1948 U.S. Air Force review declared it unable to
                            execute any aspect of its intended mission and considered canceling the program. The
                            aircraft was not considered fully operational until the 1949 F-84D model and the design
                            matured only with the definitive F-84G introduced in 1951. In 1954, the straight-wing
                            Thunderjet was joined by the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak fighter and RF-84F Thunderflash
                            photo reconnaissance aircraft.</p>

                            aircraft. Produced by North American Aviation, the Sabre is best known as the United States'
                            first swept-wing fighter that could counter the swept-wing Soviet MiG-15 in high-speed
                            dogfights in the skies of the Korean War (1950-1953), fighting some of the earliest
                            jet-to-jet battles in history. Considered one of the best and most important fighter
                            aircraft in that war, the F-86 is also rated highly in comparison with fighters of other
