                        <p>The F-80 Shooting Star was the first operational jet fighter used by the United States Air Force (USAF). Developed by Lockheed during World War II, it was designed to compete with advanced German jet aircraft like the Messerschmitt Me 262. The prototype, designated XP-80, flew for the first time in January 1944.
                        <br>
                        The F-80 featured a single-engine, straight-wing design and was powered by a centrifugal-flow turbojet. It had a maximum speed of approximately 600 mph (965 km/h) and a range of about 1,000 miles (1,609 km). Armed with six .50-caliber machine guns, it could also carry bombs and rockets, making it versatile for both air-to-air combat and ground-attack missions.</p>
